/*
BDW = Broadwell
SKL = Skylake

How to test "IsNewerThanSkylake()"?

SKL+ means (intel_device_info::ver >= 9) ?

3DSTATE_MULTISAMPLE_BODY : page 41-42

bit 4 : "Pixel Location"
When 3DSTATE_RASTER::ForcedSampleCount is other than NUMRASTSAMPLES_0, this field
must be 0h.

bits [3:1] : "Number of Multisamples"

Set to log2(PhyscalAttatchmentSampleCount), I think set to 0 == log2(1) for no attachments?

3DSTATE_RASTER_BODY : pages 59 - 63

DWORD[0] bits [20:18]  : "Forced Sample Count"

Set to (1 + lg2(ForcedSampleCount)) where lg2(0) == -1

When 3DSTATE_MULTISAMPLE::Number of Multisamples !=NUMSAMPLES_1, this field must be
either NUMRASTSAMPLES_0 or NUMRASTSAMPLES_1.
When 3DSTATE_MULTISAMPLE::Number of Multisamples == NUMSAMPLES_1, this field must
not be NUMRASTSAMPLES_1.

Page 169:
3DSTATE_RASTER
DWORD[1] bits [20:18] : "Forced Sample Count"
Seems similar to icelake.
